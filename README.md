# Abeona Adiona
Why Abeona Adiona? Abeona and Adiona are both roman dieties who ensure the safe passage of travelers! Abeona is the goddess of outward journeys, watching over those who set out on their adventure. And Adiona is the goddess of safe returns, protecting travelers as they make their way back home. So both work in tandem!

This is a travel experience review application meant to keep POC, women, and other minorities safe and comfortable while traveling.
